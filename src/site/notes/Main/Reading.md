### Books
- [Cybersecurity Canon](https://icdt.osu.edu/cybercanon/bookreviews) is OSU's list of the most influential books in cybersec
- *r/computerforensics* has a large reading list in their [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/wiki/resources)

### Websites
- [DFIR Diva](https://dfirdiva.com/) is the best DFIR resource on the net (in my opinion)
- [DNS Privacy Project](https://dnsprivacy.org/) lists the current research on DNS security
- [The Book of Secret Knowledge](https://github.com/trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge?tab=readme-ov-file#manualshowtostutorials-toc) is not a book per se, but rather a collection of various things
