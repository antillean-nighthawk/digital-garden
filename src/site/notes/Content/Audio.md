### wav, mp3

- look at waveforms with Audacity or Sonic Visualizer
- might need to convert from 1 format to another
- detect [DTMF](http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html) tones or [Morse code](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html)
- decode radio transmissions (or DTMF) with `multimon-ng`
- consider fax machine audio, SSTV, cassette tape, etc.
