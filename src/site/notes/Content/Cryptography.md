## Simple Ciphers
- Ceasar: shift left/right by a certain offset
- ROT13: Ceasar with offset of 13
- Vigen√®re: each letter uses a different Ceasar cipher, which is given by a key (use table to decrypt)
- Substitution: like Ceasar but not a set rotation
- Hashes: not really a cipher, but appears a lot in cybersec
- XOR: exclusive OR (true if only 1 out of 2 bits is set)
- Railcipher: zigzag offsets that vary in # of rails
## Sophisticated Ciphers
- [RSA](https://github.com/madfrogsec/how-to-rsa) hard to factor large prime numbers _p_ and _q_; use this to generate public and private keys
- Block: encrypt messages 1 block at a time
	- modes include ECB, CBC, PCBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, etc
- Stream: XOR with random keystream to generate OTP
	- vulnerable to key reuse and bit flipping to alter message
	- synchronous: stream generated independently of state, requires synchronous state to (en/de)crypt
	- asynchronous/self-synchronizing/CTAK: uses previous _N_ digits to compute keystream for next _N_ chars
