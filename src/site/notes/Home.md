This site is my digital garden of information. I am trying a new note taking technique that is a blend of traditional folder structure and [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) but also neither of the above. While there are folders, they exist for to provide an abstract structure and are not a means of browsing by topic. Pages also do not possess any unique identifiers, a core feature of Zettelkasten.

Info is organized into 3 [levels](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/three-layers-structure-zettelkasten/):
1. *Content* - the lowest and largest level where individual notes reside
2. *Structure* - the middle level that serves as a table of contents for organization
3. *Main* - the top level of structure that encompasses the broadest set of ideas

You can navigate the site folder-style using the sidebar or Zettelkasten style using the hyperlinks. This provides the best of both worlds. The links are for organizing themes, connecting ideas, and following a train of thought. The sidebar (and search function) allows navigation between pages that are not linked, which is good for looking up specific items or topics without going down a rabbit hole of hyperlinks.
